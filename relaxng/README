= XML validation with RELAX-NG Compact Syntax and ISO Schematron =

2013 Terradue srl
The rncv script joins trang and jing java packages with xsl files to support 
complete RELAX-NG Compact Sytnax with ISO schematron rule validation.
It updates and corrects the extract SCH from RNG iso-schematron-xslt1 package (from http://www.schematron.com/ ) and also the modified schematron skeleton code by David 
Carlisle.

(that transforms sch files in xsl)


It needs jing-trang, please download it from 
https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/


The rncv package includes updated RELAX-NG Compact Syntax schemas for ATOM 
(new ISO Schematron support and easier extensibility), OpenSearch Description
 Documents and ATOM Encoding.
It includes also some of the OpenSearch extensions currently available or under 
development.
